  The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 was passed by the Parliament of India on 11 December 2019. 
  It amended the Citizenship Act of 1955 by providing a path to Indian citizenship for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities fleeing persecution from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.
  Muslims were not given such eligibility.
  The act was the first time religion had been used as a criterion for citizenship under Indian law.
